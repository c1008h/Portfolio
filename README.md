# Portfolio

## Project Description
This is my portfolio. My contact information and past projects will be displayed on here. 

## How to navigate my Portfolio
The flow of this portfolio is clean and simple to navigate. At any time that user wants to return to the home screen, they can click on my photo or my name. My contact information is displayed. Can easily click the email image to open up their email to email me if needed. Is linked to github and users are able to view my previous work. 

## Challenges
Formatting things is still challenging. Being creative with how I want my portfolio to stand out from others is still hard. I like to make things easy to read and simple colorways but this might not be unique enough for myself to stand out. I'm missing a good resume on my portfolio. 

## Things that I want to add later
I am thinking about adding a resume and a blog to my portfolio once I create a blog. There's still some final touches I want to make on the formatting so it will look good on mobile, medium screens and large screens.
